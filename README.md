# Fibonacci Sequence Console App
I wrote this console app for a job interview. It takes a user input of a whole number can calculate and print that number in the sequence of the Fibonacci sequence. For example, if the user inputs 10,
the program will output 55. The program accomplishes this by using a formula for calculating Fibonacci numbers using the golden ratio.
